Data Collection

Existing Data:
I have downloaded the data from the kaggle. The dataset is available in csv format. Data set link: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit
The dataset is of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID or timestamp. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.


Future Enhancement

•	There is clearly room for improvement in relation to physical activity and sleeping at weekends and the generated recommendation visualised . 
•	The wearer may also wish to consider as much evidence behind this recommendation as possible and may also wish to consider their performance in relation to that of their peers.
